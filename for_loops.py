# for loops allow us to loop through something a set number of times

for x in range(10):
    print(x)


# you can loop through list as well

var_1  = "Tiles"
list_1 = [21,54,76,90,"Arnold", var_1]


for y in list_1:
    print(y)

# the variable in the for loop can be anything

# the third argument allows you to skip by when you are using range
for pizza in range(1,24,2):
    print(pizza)
